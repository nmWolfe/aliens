This is part of the Python Crash Course book. 
I will try to add whatever extra 'bits' I have learnt prior to improve upon the base code.

- The Game Itself
The classic 8bit alien invasion game. You control a spaceship, at the bottom of the screen (classically)
and you shoot at aliens/objects that fall from the top of the screen, in increasing numbers, and speed.
Generally, you can only move the spaceship left or right, and shoot upwards only.
If you clear the screen of aliens, a new fleet will appear, with more ships, and at greater speed.
If the aliens reach the bottom of the screen, or hit the player ship, the player loses a life,
and if the player loses all their lives, the game is over.
